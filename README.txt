Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the "gui" and "vehicles" folders from inside the "MAIN MOD (Install this FIRST)" folder to your <Your WoT Directory>\res_mods\<version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).

Optional:
- If you want to also remove the skins on the Russian Berlin vehicles (IS-2 Berlin, ISU-122S, & T-34-85 'Rudy'), drag the "gui", "scripts", and "vehicles" folders from inside the "ADDON - Plain ISU-122S, IS-2 Berlin, & T-34-85 'Rudy' (by Avalon304)" folder to your World of Tanks install directory as well. Thanks to Avalon304 for making them, and for giving me permission to include them as an addon in this pack. :)
- Same goes for if you want to remove the Object 252 Defender's skin - for that, drag the "gui" and "vehicles" folders from the "ADDON - Remove Defender Skin" folder to your <Your WoT Directory>\res_mods\<version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).
- If you want to also change the default USSR star, drag the .wotmod file from "ADDON - Default Emblem Swap (7th Guards)" folder to <Your WoT Folder>\mods\<Game Version> (Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\mods\0.9.20.0).

Enjoy!
