Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).
Optional:
- If you want to also remove the skins on the Russian Berlin vehicles (Russian IS-2, ISU-122S, & T-34-85 'Rudy'), drag the "res_mods" folder from inside the ADDON - PLAIN BERLIN VEHICLE SKINS (by Avalon304) folder to your World of Tanks install directory as well. Thanks to Avalon304 for making them, and for giving me permission to include them as an addon in this pack. :)
- Same goes for if you want to remove the Object 252 Defender's skin - for that, drag the "res_mods" folder from the ADDON - REMOVE OBJECT 252 DEFENDER SKIN folder to your World of Tanks install directory.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only the tanks that are currently in HD have the color swap. The non-HD tanks still have their default green color. Since WG is going to rework them into HD at some point anyways, I'd rather not have to re-do the mod twice for those tanks. Plus, the color shows up weird since they use the old model/texture system.

Enjoy!
